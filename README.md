![P4 Style Text Boxes](https://github.com/AnimatedSwine37/p4g64.p4TextBoxes/assets/24914353/de7aa5ba-1aa8-407a-a4c3-0c8a97c08e4f)

Makes the text boxes in Persona 4 Golden PC look more like those in Persona 4.

Also on [GameBanana!](https://gamebanana.com/mods/489960)

## Configuration
By default the mod will make text boxes look as close to P4 as I could get them, however, this is fully configurable. For example, you could add back the yellow stripe, the gradient in the box, or even change the colour of the box.

As long as you press the Save button, your changes take effect in real time so you can easily make text boxes look right for you.
